  Policy about how Regolith evolves over time.

Regolith Linux is continually being updated with bug fixes and feature enhancements.  Regolith's configuration files live in various places in `/etc`, mainly in `/etc/regolith/`.  To customize these files, make copies in your user directory and make changes there.  These files will not be modified by Regolith.  Existing files will not be deleted or modified, allowing the user to merge their customizations as needed.  Notification of upcoming updates that introduce breaking changes will be announced on the [Regolith Linux Announcements mailing list](https://www.freelists.org/list/regolith-linux).
