## Wallpaper

The wallpaper can be changed via `Settings`, or <span class="text-nowrap"><span class="badge badge-warning">super</span> <span class="badge badge-warning">c</span></span> by going to the `Background` tab and selecting the preferred image or color.

## Status Bar Indicators

Status indicators such as CPU load, date and time, notifications, weather, and other system info can be added or removed by installing packages.  For example, to show a status indicator for your laptop battery simply run `sudo apt install i3xrocks-battery` and then refresh the session.  To get an up date list of what's available, run `apt list | grep ^i3xrocks-` or search for "i3xrocks-" in your favorite package manager GUI, such as [Synaptic](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto).
